# Lyf Space - monitoring communal space utilization in co-living environments
Lyf Space is a data-driven platform designed to optimize communal space utilization in co-living environments. Using Arduino's ultrasonic sensors, we track the entry and exit of people to gather precise data on the usage patterns of amenities and shared spaces. This data allows us to monitor foot traffic in real-time, providing insights into peak usage times, underutilized spaces, and the impact of any changes in facilities (e.g., broken equipment) on overall utilization. With these insights, Lyf Space helps in managing resources effectively, enhancing resident experiences, and identifying opportunities for increasing revenue, such as launching additional services like meal kits.
