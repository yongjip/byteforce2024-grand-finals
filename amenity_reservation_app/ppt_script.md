# Slide 1: Title Slide

“Hello everyone! We’re excited to introduce our hackathon project: the **LYF Funan Kitchen Reservation App**. This app aims to increase the utilization of the shared kitchen amenity at LYF Funan, creating more meaningful and enjoyable experiences for residents. Let’s dive into how our solution achieves this!”

---

# Slide 2: Problem Statement

“One of the challenges LYF Funan faces is **low utilization of its shared kitchen amenity**. Residents often can’t find available slots, making it difficult to plan meals or group activities. Additionally, the kitchen’s potential for social engagement and culinary discovery is currently underutilized. Our project tackles this challenge head-on by creating a reservation system that makes the kitchen more accessible and engaging for residents.”

# Slide 3: Project Objective

“Our solution aims to transform the kitchen into a thriving community hub. With our app, residents can confidently reserve kitchen time, connect with others, and enjoy cooking without the hassle of availability issues. We also introduce **meal kits from local restaurants**, offering residents a taste of authentic Singaporean flavors. This way, residents not only enjoy cooking but also connect with the local culture through food.”

# Slide 4: Key Features

“Our app is packed with four core features to achieve our objective:

1. **Simple Reservations**: Users can book their kitchen slot in 30-minute increments, up to 3 hours daily.
2. **Social Cooking**: The app encourages residents to cook with friends or meet new people in the kitchen.
3. **Local Meal Kits**: Users can purchase meal kits from local restaurants and cook authentic dishes at home.
4. **Seamless Experience**: No logins are required—users just need an email to reserve.

These features make it easier for residents to enjoy the kitchen and use it creatively.”

# Slide 5: User Flow

“Here’s how the app works:
1. First, residents open the app and choose a time slot that works for them.
2. They reserve it, ensuring the kitchen is theirs for that time.
3. They can then choose to add a meal kit or view recipes if they want to try cooking something unique.

This straightforward user flow ensures that anyone, regardless of their tech skills, can easily reserve and enjoy the space.”

# Slide 6: Value Proposition

“The LYF Funan Kitchen Reservation App is more than a booking tool; it’s a way to build community and offer unique cultural experiences. By making it easy to reserve the kitchen and offering curated meal kits, we’re turning the kitchen into a vibrant social space where residents can connect, create, and explore. Ultimately, this increases resident satisfaction and enhances the overall value of LYF’s amenities.”

---

# Slide 7: Target Audience

“Our primary audience is **LYF Funan residents**, especially young professionals and digital nomads who are likely to enjoy a shared cooking experience. Many residents are interested in cooking, connecting with others, and learning about local cuisine, which makes this app a perfect fit for LYF’s community.”

---

# Slide 8: Technology Stack

“We chose a technology stack that supports a fast, intuitive experience. The **frontend is built with Flutter**, ensuring seamless cross-platform compatibility, and **Supabase powers our backend** to efficiently handle reservations, meal kit purchases, and data storage. This combination allows us to provide a reliable and user-friendly app for residents.”

---

# Slide 9: Project Timeline

“To ensure a smooth rollout, we’ve outlined a three-phase timeline:

- **Phase 1**: Develop and test the MVP with core features—reservations and meal kit options.
- **Phase 2**: Expand the features by adding social cooking elements and analyzing usage data.
- **Phase 3**: Gather user feedback and iterate based on their needs.

This phased approach allows us to start small, prove the concept, and then refine it based on real resident feedback.”

# Slide 10: Future Enhancements

“In the future, we plan to add more social features, like group reservations and the option to host events or themed cooking nights. Additionally, we want to introduce push notifications for open slots or meal kit specials. Eventually, we envision expanding the app to include other LYF amenities, enhancing the overall resident experience.”

---

# Slide 11: Conclusion

“In summary, our app reimagines LYF’s kitchen as a community hub where residents can cook, connect, and discover new cuisines. By offering easy reservations, social cooking opportunities, and local meal kits, we’re not just solving a logistical issue but creating a memorable experience for residents. Thank you for your attention, and we hope you’re as excited about this project as we are!”
