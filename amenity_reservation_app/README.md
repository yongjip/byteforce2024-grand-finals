# ðŸŒŸ Project: LYF Funan Kitchen Reservation App ðŸŒŸ

## Objective
Our project aims to increase utilization of LYF Funanâ€™s shared kitchen amenity by making it easier and more engaging for residents to reserve and use the kitchen space. With our app, residents can confidently reserve their cooking slots, knowing theyâ€™ll have the space they need â€“ whether they want to cook solo, with friends, other residents, or even while creating a YouTube cooking video!

## Key Features
1. **Simple Reservations:**  
   Book a time slot to ensure the kitchen is ready when needed. Slots are available in 30-minute units, up to 3 hours per day, making it easy to find a time that fits.

2. **Social Cooking & Community Building:**  
   Residents can team up with friends or connect with fellow residents through shared cooking experiences.

3. **Culinary Exploration with Local Flavors:**  
   Buy unique meal kits sourced from local Singaporean restaurants, complete with recipes and ingredients, allowing residents to cook special dishes right in the LYF kitchen.

4. **Seamless Experience:**  
   No logins are required â€“ residents simply input their email address to make and manage reservations.

## Why This Matters
This app turns LYFâ€™s kitchen into a vibrant community hub where residents can learn, share, and connect. By offering curated meal kits, residents get a taste of Singaporean cuisine in the comfort of their co-living space. Itâ€™s more than just a kitchen; itâ€™s a unique space for creativity, socializing, and culinary discovery, all made easier and more accessible through our app.
