# problem statement

## Project Name

Lyf - SOCIAL

## Existing Problems
- lyf has 2 key stakeholders : guests and property owners - the latter focuses on how utilities / amenities can be maximised to generate revenue

- Shared spaces currently donâ€™t have a system for tracking - so how can lyf diligently measure the revenue / engagement of their communal spaces (non-room space) ? Revenue per square metre?

- (low priority) No safety issues, apart from theft of food in shared spaces / washing machine from time to time

- (low priority) Noise and comfort for other guests in a shared space is a concern in communal areas

## talk points
Why humans are interested in knowing the traffic in the communal spaces?
> Understanding traffic flow and usage patterns allows property owners to identify peak times, optimize space usage, and design better layouts. It also enables lyf to assess the impact of maintenance, amenities, and specific features on guest satisfaction and engagement.


## What

1. Data Capture
   - Capture sensor data from communal spaces
2. Usage Insights and Forecasting
   - Estimate usage patterns and usage times
   - Forecast future usage
3. Impact Assessment
   - Effect of something broken on the usage
   - Use this data to make decisions on how to manage the space 
4. Revenue Optimization
   - Find average revenue per square metre
   - Average Revenue per Square Meter =
     Total Area of the Space (in square meters) / 
     Total Revenue from the Space
   - i.e. Average Revenue per Square Meter = 5000 / 50 = 100 USD per square meter

     
## How

- Arduino
- Wifi
- Python
- Firebase/supabase

For now just use faker to generate data.

## How to run

```
pip install Faker
```
