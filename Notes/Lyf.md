# Lyf

1. First lyf property opened in Sep 2019 , 3 months before covid happen
2. Some things that worked : Did away with traditional hotel lobbies ; made sure all the furniture is modular so that it can easily be converted to event / communal spaces
3. Some things that didn't work : From a survey, respondents said they didn’t need a TV in the room ; yet when it was implemented, it was poorly received…
4. Property lifecycl : To renovate is after 9 - 12 years
5. lyf usually build their properties in neighbourhoods with more character
6. Every property can choose 1 out of 5 content pillars which the Ambassador of Buzz (AOB) can align to for event / activity planning. There are toolkits for AOBs to suggest what kind of events they can organise ; guidelines
7. Lyf Ginza Tokyo ; average length of stay is 2 nights
8. Lyf in one north @singapore ; 50 - 60% long stay, average 7 day
9. Whenever guest occupancy exceeds 80%, pricing will go up to manage quality of service
10. Mandatory that all their buildings are green certified no matter the market
11. Want to be a digital brand since lyf is built for the millennial generation but it seems like we don’t emulate the necessary behaviours (i.e. we still prefer physical keycards)
12. lyf has 2 key stakeholders : guests and property owners - the latter focuses on how utilities / amenities can be maximised to generate revenue

Tips from Zhe Wen and Sophie : 
1. Think of the guest journey, what are critical guest touchpoint
2. Conceive personas / profiles coming >> what would their habits, lifestyle, behaviour be like
3. Don’t over complicate the problem and don’t try to solve everything!

Any previous incidents of security issues ? 
1. No safety issues, apart from theft of food in shared spaces / washing machine from time to time
2. How are incidents like these prevented >> security cameras
3. Tailgating by public happens very rarely
4. Most culture cannot accept shared bathrooms so no issues of voyeurism

Some existing challenges : 
1. Noise and comfort for other guests in a shared space is a concern in communal areas
2. Shared spaces currently don’t have a system for tracking - so how can lyf diligently measure the revenue / engagement of their communal spaces (non-room space) ? Revenue per square metre?
3. Spent alot of money to do mobile keys and self-check in but no one used it
4. AOBs is a very difficult role to hire , attrition rate is high cause its a stressful job
5. One of the goals lyf has is to have 150 properties by 2030 but one key challenge is how can they standardise the experience the more they expand
